# Miami-Budget

## Why
Code for Miami has been working with the local government towards transparency and to release more of its data. This project's mission is to deliver this data 

## What
Currently: A D3.js sunburst graphic of Miami Dade county's 2016 budget proposal. I say currently because the definition of this project expands as the opportunity to make this information available to the public expands with each meeting. The main purpose is to make accessible the data that the government of Miami Dade county has opened up.

The graphic was adapted from here: http://bl.ocks.org/kerryrodden/7090426
The data was published here: http://miamidade.budget.finance.socrata.com/#!/view-data

#### Status
The project is public and still under development. The goal is to get interested people more involved. [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/CHANGELOG.md).
