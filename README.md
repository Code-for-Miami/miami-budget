# Miami-Budget

## What
Currently: A D3.js sunburst graphic of Miami Dade county's 2016 budget proposal. I say currently because the definition of this project expands as the opportunity to make this information available to the public expands with each meeting. The main purpose is to inform everyone in Miami Dade about the budget for 2016.

The graphic was adapted from here: http://bl.ocks.org/kerryrodden/7090426
The data was published here: http://miamidade.budget.finance.socrata.com/#!/view-data

#### Status
The project is a prototype on pre-alpha stage. The goal is to let interested people know where this project is at. This is also a good place to link to the

[CHANGELOG](https://github.com/CHANGELOG.md).
